                        <p>In my first-year internship, I had the exciting challenge of creating a fully responsive website for a local kids' football club. Despite not being in an agency with guidance from senior developers, I gained a ton of experience tackling this huge project solo. <br><br> This opportunity didn't just end with the internship; it actually led to a continuing role with the football club as a web developer. <strong>Right now, I'm working on developing an online registration process with online payment and an admin dashboard using the MERN stack.</strong></p>

                            <p>I had to build the ENTIRE website from scratch, which meant more than just coding it. First, I had to lay out the structure of the site, then develop the content and its design, before finally diving into the coding phase. For someone who had primarily focused on web development, this project pushed me to wear multiple hats, utilizing the diverse skill set I had acquired during my first year at university. Additionally, I honed my SEO skills, as my goal wasn't just to build the website, but also to optimize it to rank at the top of Google search results.</p>

Unfortunately, there is too little information about it online. That's why I've thought of an interactive way to introduce this course to the public: show what it's like by telling a story from the viewpoint of an outsider who joins first-year students on their final projects. Through this fictional experience, the user learns more about the course.</p>

                            <p>Due to the intense workload, my time on this project was limited, which meant I had to learn about handling APIs, working with JSON/CSV files, and mastering Chart.js and the more advanced D3.js library in a very short period. This time constraint forced me to concentrate exclusively on the essential skills needed for the project, without delving into broader concepts. For example, in D3.js, I focused solely on what was necessary to create a choropleth map. As a result, while I'm now proficient in map creation, I can't construct even a basic line graph. This experience taught me to efficiently target and acquire specific technical skills under tight deadlines. </p>

We designed a simple dashboard to screen these messages and prevent trolling.). his project marked my first experience collaborating with a full team of content creators and web designers, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience. While my focus was on web development, the real learning curve for me was in team management and communication. Additionally, creating an interactive game for the campaign presented a unique and intriguing challenge.</p>

                    <p>Role : Front end dev</p>
                    <p>Our MMI APP will provide students with a comprehensive, one-stop solution for their academic and extracurricular needs with its features such as timetable management, assignment tracking, and grade monitoring within a single, user-friendly platform. Additionally, students can create and discover events, develop connections with peers.

                        <br><br>

                    Throughout this project, each of us aims to enhance and extend our current skill sets. Personally, this marks my inaugural real-world project in React, and my goal is to apply everything I've learned so far to solidify my understanding and mastery of this framework. Furthermore, although my primary role will be as a front-end web developer, I will also contribute to some of the back-end aspects.

                    <p>A breath of fresh air, a bit of craziness, dilgent... Hi, I'm Ayoub. Born in the warm tones of Morocco (9y), I grew up absorbing the elegance of France (6y), the resilience of Guinea (3y), and the modern vibes of the UK(3y).

                        <br><br>

                        Crafting code, witnessing a project grow from an abstract idea, coding on a project for hours not realising that it's already morning and not having slept a wink, it was an immediate infatuation. 
                        <br><br>
                        Front-end, Back-end, SEO, UI/UX, project management – I wear multiple hats, but they all fit perfectly. Through each line of code and every pixel, I build solutions on the web.
